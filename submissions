## Summary
- I created a table in DynamoDB
- I then created a lambda function to get the JSON resume from the table
- I created a RESt API using API Gateway and integrated it with the Lambda function.
- As an extra, I created a Frontend to stylize the API from the API URL.
- I then created a CI/CD pipeline using Github Actions to keep my codes up to date
