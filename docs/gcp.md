## GCP Resume API Challenge

Welcome to the GCP Resume API Challenge. A project where you will have the opportunity to build and deploy a serverless API using Google Cloud Functions and Firestore, integrated with GitHub Actions. The primary goal? Construct an API that can serve resume data in JSON format.

## Challenge Objective üéØ

Your task is to create an Cloud Function that fetches resume data stored in Firestore and return it in JSON format. To level up the challenge, integrate GitHub Actions to automatically deploy updates to your Cloud Function whenever you push changes to your git repository.

## Key Requirements

- Firestore Table: Set up a table named `Resumes` containing sample resume data.
- Google Cloud Function: Fetch and return resume data based on an id. Utilize HTTP Trigger with anonymous access.
- GitHub Actions: Automatically package and deploy your Lambda function on every push to the repository.

**Bonus**: Use [Google Cloud Deployment Manager](https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/docs) or [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) for infrastructure as code!

## Getting Started üöÄ

- **Set Up GCP**: If you haven't already, sign up for an GCP account and set up your credentials. Remember, when using GCP secrets and never expose them in your code.
- **Create a JSON Resume**: Use [this schema](https://jsonresume.org/schema/) to create your own JSON resume.
- **Create GCP Resources**: Deploy the needed GCP services - Firestore and Google Cloud Function.
- **Create Your Workflow**: Use the provided template as a guide, but feel free to innovate!
- **Test Everything**: Ensure your API works as expected and the GitHub Actions deploy smoothly.

## Submission Guidelines üì•

Ensure all your code is in a GitHub repository.
Make sure your README has detailed instructions on how to run and test your API.
Write a blog post sharing the things you learned during building this project.

Once you're ready to submit, create a pull request to this repository.
Add your name, github repo URL and the resume API URL to the table in `submissions.md` file.
In your pull request, provide a summary of what you've done and any additional features or functionalities you've added.

All the submission can be found [here](/submissions).

## Completion Criteria üèÜ

- Functionality: Does the API work? Does the deployment succeed via GitHub Actions?
- Code Quality: Is the code clean, well-organized, and documented?
- Innovation: Did you add any extra features or use any unique methods?
